# ☁️ Weather Forecasting 

This project demonstrates how to forecast weather parameters using machine learning models. It covers the entire workflow from data collection and preprocessing, to model training, evaluation, and future weather prediction.

## 📁 Project Overview

The notebook includes:

* Loading and cleaning historical weather datasets
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of weather trends
* Feature engineering such as creating lag variables and handling missing values
* Training and tuning machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks)
* Model evaluation using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R²
* Visualizing predicted vs. actual weather values
* Making forecasts for future dates based on historical patterns

## 📊 Techniques Used

* Data preprocessing and normalization
* Feature selection and creation of time-based features (e.g., rolling averages)
* Supervised learning models for regression tasks
* Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for model optimization
* Model interpretability and feature importance analysis
* Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

## 📦 Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Dataset Description

The dataset contains historical weather observations from \[data source, e.g., NOAA, Kaggle, OpenWeatherMap], including features such as:

* Date/Time: Timestamp of the observation
* Temperature (°C)
* Humidity (%)
* Wind Speed (km/h)
* Atmospheric Pressure (hPa)
* Precipitation (mm)

The data is cleaned and formatted for time series regression modeling.

## 🔍 Key Learnings

* Handling time series data for machine learning
* Importance of feature engineering in weather forecasting
* Comparison of different regression models for weather prediction
* Evaluating model performance with regression metrics
* Visualizing trends and forecast accuracy
